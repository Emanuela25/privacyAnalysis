# Mitmproxy Scripting API

Mitmproxy has a powerful scripting API that allows you to control almost any aspect of traffic being 
proxied. In fact, much of mitmproxyâ€™s own core functionality is implemented using the exact same API 
exposed to scripters (see [mitmproxy/addons](../mitmproxy/addons)).

This directory contains some examples of the scripting API. We recommend to start with the
ones in [simple/](./simple).

Some inline scripts may require additional dependencies, which can be installed using
`pip install mitmproxy[examples]`.
